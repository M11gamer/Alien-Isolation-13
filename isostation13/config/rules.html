<h1><b>Rules of Eris: Alien Isolation 13</b></h1>
<br>
<br>
Rule 0. Spouting memes will lead to an instant week long ban. No appealing.
<br>
Rule 1. Have fun and RP, maintain character. Yes, this rule also matters if you're the round antag.
<br>
This means to not meta/powergame. You don't know what the xeno is or how it does its things or why, just that it's black and scary and bad for buisness.

Rule 2. No erp, no exceptions.
<br>
Rule 3. No Metacomms.

            Ex: Don't mutiny against the captain if he killed you the last round.
Rule 5. You may only build defenses/collect armory guns etc once the threat is known commonly. Ex.
 Guy screams over radio that there's a big nasty bad thing. You now know that the bad nasty thing exists.
<br>
 Rule 6. Being exceptionally shitty at a role will get you a week jobban, if you persist being shitty at the role you will get a month ban,
if you somehow become a shitlord at the job, you will be  banned for a month from that job.
<br>
